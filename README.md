# Automated-Server-Creation
Basic C# script to automatically create a vanilla minecraft server.
Requires everything required to make a minecraft server, so pretty much just the latest release of Java.
Does not handle the port forwarding because that'd be sketchy if it could access your routers settings and alter them.
